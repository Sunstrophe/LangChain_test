# Project GuidingAgent
This project aims to create a persistent chatbot to guide the user.</br>
The chatbot should be capable of using a tool to search for an answer in a vector database.</br>
Also included will be the embedding function to fill the vector database.

# Information
This project uses langchain, langgraph and langsmith.</br>
The vector database I will use i ChromaDB since it comes included with its own module in langchain.</br>
The information I intend to use is found on the UESP wiki, https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page.</br>
Since they are kind enough to provide an xml file on their website.
